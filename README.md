**_IT'S LIT!_** We all know the famous game of tetris. It's the game where you are given pieces made up of 4 square blocks in various forms, also known as the *tetromino*. These pieces fall from the top of the board and slowly go down the game board. The objective is use this pieces to fill up the one or more rows. When you fill up one or more rows, it will clear that row out which will increase your score. The only way to lose is if you stack your pieces beyond the the last row in the game board. The higher your score the faster the pieces fall.
